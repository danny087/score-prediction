## Score-predictor

With score-predictor you can predicted every matchday premier league game and earn points for every correct result and scoreline.

If you predicted the right scoreline you will earn 5 points.

If you predicted the right result you will earn 3 points.

Make your own table and compete with your freinds with the amount of points earned.

Please be aware that with it being season break, the brazilian league will be active but when the premier league starts again it will switch over to the premier league.

### `Getting started`

First clone the repo to your local machine by using

https://github.com/danny087/score-prediction.git

then you will need to install the dependencies, and run the project locally:

npm install
npm start



### `known issues`

I am using the free plan of my API so when to many requests are made, a 429 error will occur, wait for about 20 seconds and you can start to use the app again.
